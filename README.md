## to do next time/what to test:
- **download new version
- **save it in the extension folder
- **reload pyrevit
- **on projekt1 press the new updated extension to export csv

- **it should by default suggest the c drive as the saving location instead of the location of the extension
- **when choosing a location, the csv export should work - last test threw an error during the csv export.

## Future ideas:

- able to upload a csv from an excel sheet with headers - the code should try and recognize the columns for what is what, and do a suggestion, you can manually overwrite if you dont agree, and from this, you can calculate the esg - should also in a user friendly way let the user know if a set of information is missing, blocking it from calculating the emissions
